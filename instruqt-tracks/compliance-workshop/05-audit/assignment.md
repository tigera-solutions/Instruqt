Archive logs
===============

Logs can be exported to an external SIEM, such as Splunk, syslog, or Amazon S3. For further information, see archive logs section in [Calico documentaion.](https://docs.tigera.io/visibility/elastic/archive-storage)

Compliance reports
===============

Using the **Compliance Reports** tab of Calico Cloud, you can create a number of reports to satisfy various PCI DSS, SOC 2, GDPR, and other internal organization compliance reporting requirements.
Calico Cloud supports the following built-in report types:

- Inventory
- Network Access
- Policy-Audit
- CIS Benchmark

We have already scheduled some reports to run daily.

Check `GlobalReports` in your environment

```bash
kubectl get globalreports
```

For the purpose of this workshop, we will run these reports manually using the following script:

```bash
./run-reports.sh
```

To view the generated reports in Calico Cloud, click on **Compliance** from the left menu. You also export these reports.
