üöÄ Let's build the Hipstershop application
==============

First, create a namespace called 'hipstershop' for the demo application:

```
kubectl create namespace hipstershop
```

Next we will deploy the Online Boutique (Hipstershop) application to the namespace.

```
kubectl apply -n hipstershop -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo/main/release/kubernetes-manifests.yaml
```

Verify pods are running

```
kubectl get pods -n hipstershop
```

Output should be similar to the following:

```
root@controlplane:~# kubectl get pods -n hipstershop

```

Creating MultiTool container for testing
==============

The Network-MultiTool pod will be used in two namespaces to test the created security policies.

First, deploy the MultiTool into the default namespace:

```bash
kubectl run multitool --image=wbitt/network-multitool
```

Next, deploy a copy of the Mutlitool into the hipstershop namespace:

```bash
kubectl run multitool -n hipstershop --image=wbitt/network-multitool
```

Verify that both pods are up and running:

```bash
kubectl get pods -A | grep multitool
```

Both pods should be Running:

```bash
default                      multitool                                        1/1     Running            0              12s
hipstershop                  multitool                                        1/1     Running            0              31m
```

‚úÖ Check Hipstershop in Calico Cloud
==============

Go to Service Graph in Calico Cloud and ensure that hipstershop application is running.
To view resources in the "hipstershop" namespace click on the `Service Graph` icon on the left menu.
Click on `Default` view for a top level view of the cluster resources:
